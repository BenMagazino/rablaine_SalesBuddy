# tag-changelog.ps1
#
# Tag the topmost untagged CHANGELOG.md heading with the short SHA of the
# most recent merge commit on the current branch, then create a "Tag
# changelog for <hash>" commit.
#
# Workflow:
#   1. On a feature branch, make your code change(s) and commit them.
#   2. Edit CHANGELOG.md, prepend a new section like:
#        ## 4/29/2026
#        - what you did
#      Leave the heading without a hash. Commit + push as normal.
#   3. After the user signs off and the branch is merged into main with
#      `git merge --no-ff` (creating a merge commit), check out main and
#      run this script. It rewrites the topmost untagged heading to:
#        ## 4/29/2026 - <merge-short-sha>
#      and commits the change directly on main as a separate
#      "Tag changelog" commit. Push that.
#
# Why merge commits: the admin Updates card filters changelog entries by
# commit hash. Tagging the merge commit means a single user-visible
# update maps to a single hash, even if it took multiple commits inside
# the feature branch to build.
#
# Run from the repo root:
#   .\scripts\tag-changelog.ps1
#
# Optional: pass -DryRun to print what would happen without committing.
